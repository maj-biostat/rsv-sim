# rsv-sim

Simulation report and outline for design note website.
At the time of writing the focus has been predominantly on the simulation report.

The simulations use `just`, see https://github.com/casey/just for automation.
`just` is essentially a simplified and less obscure version of `make` without the dependency checks.
Use `just -l` to list targets then `just sim01 [cfgfilename]` to run using simulation design 01.


## todo

convert output to word doc

use simplified tables
determine how to deal with ggplot output scaling

incorporating timing and summarise duration of trial
