# rsv-sim

Simulation report and outline for design note website.
At the time of writing the focus has been predominantly on the simulation report.

The simulations use `just`, see https://github.com/casey/just for automation.
`just` is essentially a simplified and less obscure version of `make` without the dependency checks.
Use `just -l` to list targets then `just sim01 [cfgfilename]` to run using simulation design 01.


## todo

add example trials
reduce baseline risk to check sensitivity
make sim00 consistent with sim01 in terms of lspec.
once done, propagate lspec change implications through to reporting

convert output to word doc
use simplified tables?
determine how to deal with ggplot output scaling
