# About {.unnumbered}

Version of quarto used for this site is `r system("$(which quarto) --version", intern = TRUE, ignore.stderr = TRUE)`.

::: callout-warning
There is usually a version of quarto installed with RStudio.
For example, on my machine this is `/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/quarto`.
But, this is not the latest version.
I leave the RStudio version alone, install a new version of quarto on my machine, independent to RStudio, and then render everything through the CLI.
